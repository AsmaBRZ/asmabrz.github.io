In this post, I will present my works on crowd detection. Crowd detection is the task of classifying and localizing crowd in images (see Fig. 1). In this work, I am particularly interested in pedestrians crowd detection. I mostly used image processing methods to isolate the crowd from non-interesting objetcs and background. Specifically, the classification task is based on fractal dimension and the localization task is based on local density.

According to Google Scholar, 1460 papers have been published concerning crowd detection ot this day. There are a myriad of areas where crowd detection is useful [1]. The figure Fig. 2 shows some of these areas.

Thanks to the amazing progress of technology in the medical field, cancer patients can  more and more be saved. Detecting a certain number of cancerous cells, thus forming a crowd, may help for an early-stage diagnosis.

The health sector continues to improve thanks to new technologies. 

Disaster management generally concerns overcrowding scenarios such as music events. If any panic breaks out among a crowd of thousands of persons, their lives are definitely in danger. Detect overcrowded areas as earlier as possible may avoid the worst scenario.

Crowd detection enables  safety and monitoring procedures to be automated. It can be hepful to detect anomalies  and thereby predict risks. 

Moreover, crowd detection is valuable for public event management. The supervisory authorities will receive a notification as soon as a public demonstration occures. Therfore, this will greatly assist them to restore calm and order.

Another significant case where crowd detection can be relevant it comes to track suspicious activity. For instance, people who are fighting necessarily attract other people and this may exacerbate the situation. So, with crowd detection the security officials receive information regarding suspicious activity in the area, and thus can intervene.

## Further Steps

## Conclusion
The proposed model is still far from saturating the benchmark metrics. If complicated backgrounds are crossed, the model may miss  targets or may provide an imprecise bounding box. However, the model is only based on image processing methods for the task of crowd detection. In addition, no intelligence is behind the established process.
