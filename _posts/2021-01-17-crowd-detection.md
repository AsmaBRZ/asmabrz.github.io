In this post, I will present my works on crowd detection. Crowd detection is the task of classifying and localizing crowd in images (see Fig. 1). In this work, I am particularly interested in pedestrians crowd detection. I mostly used image processing methods to isolate the crowd from non-interesting objetcs and background. Specifically, the classification task is based on fractal dimension and the localization task is based on local density.

According to Google Scholar, 1460 papers have been published concerning crowd detection ot this day. There are a myriad of areas where crowd detection intervenes. The figure Fig. 2 shows some of these areas.

## Further Steps

## Conclusion
The proposed model is still far from saturating the benchmark metrics. If complicated backgrounds are crossed, the model may miss  targets or may provide an imprecise bounding box. However, the model is only based on image processing methods for the task of crowd detection. In addition, no intelligence is behind the established process.
