Hello guys!

I'm a 3rd-year PhD student in Computer Vision. I am working on 6D Object detection, with a focus on novel object detection without retraining the network. I have 2 master's degree: the first one from Pierre and Marie Curie University where I studied Artifcial Intelligence, MultiAgents Systems and Robotics. The robotics courses pushed me to develop a particular interest in vision applications, I decided to devote a year to specialize in vision by doing a second master's degree at Paris-Descartes University, entitled Vision & Intelligent Machine. 

This website is a container for personal and university projects in Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Vision.
