Hello guys!

I have just graduated from Pierre and Marie Curie University where I studied Artifcial Intelligence, Robotics & Vision. As I am particularly attracted to Vision applications, I decided to devote a year to specialize in Vision by doing a second master's at Paris-Descartes University. 

This website is a containter for personal and university projects in Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Vision.
