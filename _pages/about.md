I’m currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate at CEA-Saclay and ENPC-LIGM, supervised by Vincent Lepetit, and specializing in Computer Vision, with a research focus on 6D object detection. My current work centers on 6D object pose distribution.

I hold two master’s degrees. My first is from Pierre and Marie Curie University, where I specialized in Artificial Intelligence, Multi-Agent Systems, and Robotics. This exposure to robotics sparked my deep interest in vision-based applications, motivating me to pursue a second master’s degree in Vision and Intelligent Machines at Paris-Descartes University. This additional year allowed me to deepen my expertise in Computer Vision and further refine my technical foundation in intelligent machine perception.
